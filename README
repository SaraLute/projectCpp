README file to the c++ project assignment of Sumit Mohanty and Sara Lute.
The assignment is a food ordering and delivery calculation system.

--> main.cpp
    This file uses and combines all created classes into a working assignment. The user is being lead through a
    series of questions and will this way create an account and place an order.

    --> userData
        This class contains functions that create a user with name, address and the corresponding coordinates. The class
        returns the name, address and coordinates of the destination of an order aka the person who ordered.

    --> newOrder
        This class contains functions that ask for user input on the order. The class returns a restaurant and the
        items that were picked from the corresponding menu.

    --> deliveryMen
        This class contains functions that take the location of the restaurant chosen in the newOrder class and
        calculates the closest delivery person in the system. The class returns the index number of the closest delivery
        person, the coordinates of the closest person and the name of the closest delivery person.

    --> trackDelivery
